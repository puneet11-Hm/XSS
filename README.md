# XSS
Cross Site Scripting Demo
Prerequisites for the project: Apache Server, MongoDB, PHP 5+ Activity:

1. Login as genuine user, and fetch all records based on login post request.
Using Hackbar add-on, try to intercept the post request and change/modify parameters as below:
username=pkaur&password=pkaur&submit=Login
Modify above request to username[$ne]=1&password[$ne]=1&submit=Login

2. Bypass authentication by logging into other user’s account following similar procedure.
From above request, we will get to know the usernames of all users, Now run the query as below:
username=john&password[$ne]=1&submit=Login

3. Update other user’s information as below:
Login as John and click on Edit link, steal his User ID in following ways:
Inspecting through Firebug when user id is stored in a hidden field.
Grab it from Cookie value.
Get it from GET URL request.

4. Login a own users’ account and while edit profile information, inspect and modify user id with the stolen id, 
this will update other’s information with attacker’s desired inputs.
5. Delete other user’s account, steal user Id of other user by logging into their account, append this Id to the 
delete request.
